# Octopus Project



This is a **student project** made during the summer vacations.

The **instructions** were really simple: **explore the topics you want**, as long as it has to do with programming for video games and it's something you do not know yet.

I chose to learn about **Inverse Kinematics** and **shaders** in Unity, because both sounded (and actually were) very **fun**.

Here is the final look of the scene:

## Contents of repo

In this repo you will find:

* a blender folder containing the blender file of the tentacle
* a build folder containing the build of the main scene as showed above
* an images folder containing all gifs and screenshots of IK and shaders
* an Octopus folder containing the Unity project in itself, with two scenes (MainScene is the one showed above and Shaders is the one with all the demos of the shaders I made)



## Inverse Kinematics

Here is the first working step of IK with 5 joints:

And here is what it looks like with a tentacle made with Blender and its skeleton made of 43 bones:

## Shaders

I had a lot of fun coding various shaders and learning many new things about how they work.

I especially focused on **recreating all the features of the default shader** from Unity with a **fragment and vertex shader**: albedo, texture, metallic, emission, lighting, shadows...

I also did a **surface shader** for the **water** in the main scene.

Here are some examples of the shaders I made:

For this project I was helped by a lot of great tutorials:

* Those of Jasper Flick (CatLikeCoding) about shaders: [link](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/)
* The one of Surfaced Studio about modelling, rigging and animating a tentacle in Blender: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ap-5D1oRbE)
